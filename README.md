# ATOM: Automated Tools for Optimizing Materials

ATOM is a platform for accelerating materials discovery through AI, ML, and quantum simulations.

## Features
- Data upload and exploration
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Integration with first-principles simulations

## Setup Instructions
### Backend
1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Flask server:
```python
python app/main.py
```
### Frontend
1. Navigate to the 'frontend' directory and start the React app:
`npm start'

## TODOs
